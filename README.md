# Tic-Tac-Toe

The Tic Tac Toe game created in C++ is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. The game is built using basic C++ concepts, making it a great project for both beginners and experienced programmers.

## Features:
-> Multiplayer Mode: Two players can play against each other, alternating turns to place their marks ('X' or 'O') on the grid.

-> Grid Display: The game displays the 3x3 grid, updating it after each move to show the current state of the game.

-> Win Detection: The game checks for winning conditions after each move, declaring a winner if a player manages to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).

-> Draw Condition: If all spaces on the grid are filled without any player achieving three in a row, the game declares a draw.

-> Input Validation: The game ensures that players can only place their marks on empty spaces and handles invalid inputs gracefully.

## Implementation Details:

-> Console-Based: The game runs in the console, providing text-based interaction.

-> Simple Logic: Utilizes basic loops, conditionals, and functions to manage game flow and logic.

-> User-Friendly Interface: Clear prompts and instructions guide the players throughout the game.
